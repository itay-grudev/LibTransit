LibTransit
==========

LibTransit is a C++ library, based on the algorithm proposed by Kjurkchieva, Dimitrov, Vladev and Yotov [(MNRAS 2013)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1303.2573.pdf) for the direct problem for modeling of transiting exoplanets for arbitrary limb-darkening law.

**This library is currently under development and major redesign for performence improvement. The source code available here is not in a completed state.**

Extending functionallity further LibTransit will support solving the reverse problem and calculate a system parameters by performing simulations and comparing the results with an observed planetary transit.
